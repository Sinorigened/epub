<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p class="francesa">Despite of the mainstream narratives of the Kumbh Mela been an millenarian continuum within the Hindu tradition; historical proofs prove that the actual form and function of the ritual is a product of an adaptation process bis a bis the historical transformations inside the sub-continent. This process highlights the political aspect of the pilgrimage as an archetypical vehicle towards the construction of a sense of communitas and territoriality which has been a powerful element in the cohesion and formation of a flexible identity in an otherwise deeply heterogeneous context. However, although this process has an irrational-affective beginning this pedagogical function can be rationalized and, by means of appropriation and interpretation of the history, become instrumental for diverse interests that can vary from the establishment of a national project, to the projection of an especiphic group of interest to power or the exclusion of the ‘other’.</p>
<p>It is in this sense that this festival is already experiencing another major transformation: its aperture to a globalized world which, in similar fashion than the Mela feared by the British, goods, ideas and people can be exchanged with each other. More than ten years inside the XXIst century is hard to imagine a way in which the festival can be protected from ‘polluting’ agents.  Yet  it’s even harder to claim the absence of them in its past. The only way in which the existence of the Mela can be jeopardized (if ever) would be by the denial of the ‘home’ society from its values and traditions, not by the formal changes that have been common during this research.</p>
