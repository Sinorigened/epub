<h3 class="titp" id="uCTZa74NsyYpf4Dyj7v9xZ7">The symbolism of the Samudra Mathan</h3>
<p>Being present in ancient records scattered among an area that goes from the deep jungles of Angkor Watt in Vietnam to Kashmir to Sri Lanka and supported over the complementary but certainly different traditions of the <i>epic-puranic</i> verses and the Indian traditional astrologic tradition of the Jyotish is not a surprise that the creational myth of the churning of the ocean is told in many different fashions. Hereby is the most common story along with comments about some alternative mythical happenings.</p>
<p>It started long time ago. When the ‘whole’ was nothing but the immense sky (<i>akaash</i>) and a Primordial Ocean (<i>Kshîra Sagara</i>) in which Brahma was floating in an ecstatic trance. Eons after, upon his awakening he created the universe along with gods, demons, treasures and curses. This was way before time itself, but not before war on earth. While some historians claim that the god and demons started chourning the ocean as a way to speed up the process of creation<span id="fnref1"><a epub:type="noteref" href="part1themyth.xhtml#fn1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a></span>, the most popular narrative says that gods and demons were immerse in a millennia lasting battle over the supremacy on the universe<span id="fnref2"><a epub:type="noteref" href="part1themyth.xhtml#fn2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a></span>.
</p><p>Although blessed with extreme longevity, the gods (<i>Devas</i>) were having heavy losses among their ranks as the demons (<i>Asuras</i>) overpowered them in strength. Moreover, when the latter were killed they were restored in life by the power (<i>sanjivanividya</i>) of their spiritual preceptor <i>Sukracarya</i>. Thus, the only way the gods had to keep the balance was to acquire the same skill of their enemies and for that they used their superior intelligence.</p>
<p>The first attempt was to infiltrate the demon ranks. Kaca was sent to learn the magic of Sukracarya. He was caught and killed on three different occasions and that would have meant the end for the Deva’s enterprise had not been for the intervention of Devayani, Sukracarya’s daughter who was nesting a secret love towards the divine spy. On his last attempt, Kaca acquires the secret knowledge of Sukracarya and is ready to join back the ranks of the gods when Devayani appears asking him to marry her. Kaca refuses; for him, his unknown savior, being the daughter of his guru, was more like a younger sister. Devayani, heart-broken and enraged throws a curse on him cleaning his mind from all the knowledge and charms he had learned during his time with the demons.</p>
<p>Far from been defeated, the Devas came out with a second plan, this time far more ambitious, which was suggested by Lord Vishnu himself. They needed to get a grasp of the elixir of immortality (<i>Amrit</i>) which was said to be somewhere in the bottom of the great ocean of milk. The plan paradoxically required the cooperation of their enemies as only the sum of both divine and demonic powers would suffice for the task of excavating the hidden treasures from the sea bed of creation. This in mind, the gods called for a truce and on parliament Vishnu, Varuna, Indra and Shiva representing the god’s side invited Virocana, Bali, Sambhara and Nemi, the chiefs of the demons to join ranks for this endeavor with the guileful suggestion of sharing the unearthed treasures on the aftermath.</p>
<h3 class="titp" id="uXqVlh6AWOPB8YWGsvjH9PH">The churning of the ocean</h3>
<p>It was a unanimous decision. The two parties would stand on each side of the ocean with the gods holding the tail and the demons the head of the great serpent <i>Ananta Naga</i> or <i>Vasuki</i> which they would use to spin the <i>Mandara Mountain</i> set as a churning rod. Once in their respective positions with enormous noise they started the <i>Samudra Manthan</i> or Churning of the Ocean which released on the first place the gases, fire, electricity and all the luminous objects of creation.</p>
<div class="image">
<img class="imgreg" alt="churningofthemilk" src=".../images/churningofthemilk.jpg"/>
</div>
<p>After one thousand years, Vasuki expelled the deadly <i>Halala</i> or <i>Kalakootam</i> poison and as it was emerging to the surface of the ocean threatening to destroy life and the entire cosmos asphyxiating with deadly fumes both gods and demons fear was experienced from the first time. Scared, friends and foes asked Shiva the great ascetic, to save them from their agony and he, took it with one hand and drank it all. Worried, his wife Parvati grasped his neck in order to prevent him from swallowing the deadly substance leaving only a permanent blue print on his neck.</p>
<p>Having saved the universe and freed from fear, Devas and Asuras re-started their labor. Yet, after another thousand years, the base of the mountain Mandara crumbled before the pressure and started sinking into the sea.      This time was Vishnu, the protector, who stood up for the challenge and turning himself into his second avatar, the gigantic tortoise <i>Kurma</i>, he hold the mountain on his back for another thousand years.</p>
<p>Finally the efforts began to yield results and fourteen gems emerged from the bottom of the sea and one by one were distributed among the members of the provisional alliance. The goddess <i>Lakshmi</i>; <i>Kaustubha</i> the priceless ruby; <i>Kamadhenu</i> the all-providing cow; and <i>Haridhenu</i>, the celestial bow were taken by lord Vishnu. <i>Candrama</i>, the crescent moon was set over Shiva’s jata. <i>Airavatagaja</i>, the white elephant became Indra’s ride, <i>Parijataka</i>, one of the five trees of paradise; <i>Sura</i> the goddess or spirituous liquor who went on the demonic side; <i>Ucchaisravas</i> the seven-headed horse; <i>Sankha</i>, the celestial conch; Rambha, the celestial nymph; <i>Varuni</i>, which was choosen by Varuna to be his wife and last of all: the celestial doctor, <i>Dhanvatari</i> came out carrying in his hands a  pitcher (<i>kumbh</i>) contained the holy elixir of inmortality: The amrita. As soon as the long awaited treasure appeared before them the truce between gods and demons was broken. Devas and Asuras scrambled and rushed trying to get a grasp of the sacred container. Here onwards, the myth has two different versions.</p>
<p>One version says that once again the demon’s superior strength and stamina was giving them the upper hand over the pot, however the Devas, foreseeing this scenario sent Indra’s son, <i>Jayanta</i> the gatekeeper of paradise to retrieve the treasure and him, turning himself into a rook, grabed the pitcher and flied into heaven. Four celestial bodies joined him in his journey: The Moon, the Sun, Jupiter and Saturn (the last one, to protect the contents from Jayanta itself). The flight took him twelve celestial days during which he took rest at four different locations: Two of them along the stream of the Ganges: the first one, lying at the entrance of the Gangetic plains in <i>Haridwar</i>, State of Uttaranchal and <i>later at the Triveni sangam of Prayag</i> (modern Allahabad) in Uttar Pradesh, followed by the birth place of the Godavari (also known as the <i>Dakshin Ganga</i> or southern Ganges) in <i>Nasik</i>, Maharastra; and <i>Ujjain</i> next to the Kshipra river in Madhya Pradesh. An every time he placed the holiest of the holies in the banks of the rivers blessing them for time being.</p>
<p>In spite of Jayanta efforts the demons manage to appear in heaven just before the gods could drink it. Again Vishnu intercedes, and taking the female form of the goddess <i>Mohini</i> (delusion) lures the Kumbh away from the Asuras and distributes it among the Devas sealing the demon’s defeat. One of the demons, however manages to have some drops of the Amrit before been beheaded by Vishnu’s solar disc and since then Rahu become a planet in the skies.</p>
<p>On the other story<span id="fnref3"><a epub:type="noteref" href="part1themyth.xhtml#fn3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a></span> it is Garuda, the king of birds and Vishnu’s transport, who got a hand on the Kumbh but latter brought the nectar from heaven to release his mother <i>Vinata</i> from the bondage of the mother of serpents, <i>Kadru</i>. He placed the pot of nectar before the sons of <i>Kadru</i> and <i>Vinata</i> was freed. But Indra stole away the pitcher and fled towards heaven being pursued by the serpents. Four drops of nectar fell down from the jar on the forenamed four places, and therefore these places became fit for celebrating the Kumbhaparva.</p>
<p>These events marked the Indian-subcontinent religious (and quite possible socio-political) landscape forever. Yet, the astrological and symbolical tradition of the ritual, although complementary to the mythical origins of the Kumbh Mela is far more complex and controversial.</p>
<h3 class="titp" id="ukVyyPN9cmOeCf2gwunHsY2">The “Kumbh” controversy</h3>
<p>According to the Indian astrological tradition (<i>Jyoti</i>) the role of the planets and the stars during the Amrit drama is a central part of the reproduction of the <i>Kumbhaparva</i>, or ritual of the Kumbh. For a Kumbh Mela to be held, an especiphic astronomical conjunction (<i>kumbhayoga</i><span id="fnref4"><a epub:type="noteref" href="part1themyth.xhtml#fn4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a></span>) must take place. As there are four different locations mentioned in the myth, four different kumbhayogas identify the time and location of the festival. Regarding this dates, D.P. Dubey<span id="fnref5"><a epub:type="noteref" href="part1themyth.xhtml#fn5" class="footnote-ref"><sup>5</sup></a></span> provides the following translations from the Skanda Purana:</p>
<div class="poe">
<p>Jupiter (Brihaspati) is in the sign of Aquarius (Kumbharasi) and the Sun enters Aries (Mesarasi), the Kumbhaparva is held in Haridwar.[…]</p>
<p>The Kumbhaparva occurs at prayag when Jupiter enters the zodiac Aries and the Sun and the Moon are in the Capricornus (Makararasi) on the new moon day of the month of Magha.[…]</p>
<p>When the Sun and Jupiter are in the Leo (Simharasi), the Kumbhaparva is celebrated on the Godavari at Nasik.[…]</p>
<p>The Kumbhaparva takes place at Ujjayini when Jupiter is in Leo and the Sun enters the constellation of Aries […]</p>
</div>
<p>The above mentioned sources also reveal a significant fact regarding the narratives surrounding the Melas of Allahabad, Nasik and Ujjayini. According to Dubey, none of them are given the prefix ‘Kumbh’ in the original source since a strict astronomically-oriented definition of the Kumbh would be the one celebrated in Haridwar.</p>
<div class="image">
<img class="imgmap" alt="cosmogram" src=".../images/cosmogram.png"/>
</div>
<p>This is due to the fact that “It appears that the Kumbhparva derives its names from an auspicious occasion of ritual bathing that has used to take place in Haridwar (sic) every twelfth year when Jupiter was in Aquarius and the Sun entered in Aries. Such an astronomical conjunction is referred to in the <i>Naradiya Purana</i> as a sacred time for bathing in the river Ganges in Haridwar. This shows that the Kumbaparva was originally observed at Haridwar and was named after the <i>Kumbharasi</i> (Aquarius), for the festival occurs mainly at the time Jupiter being in Aquarius which is represented in astrology as the water-carrier. At Prayaga, Nasik and Ujjayini, the Kumbhayoga is not connected to any celestial body being in the Kumbharasi.”<span id="fnref6"><a epub:type="noteref" href="part1themyth.xhtml#fn6" class="footnote-ref"><sup>6</sup></a></span></p>

<h3 id="ut2vkQzQ6XGJazAzk4lR7W6">Pilgrimage, Cosmogram and comunnitas</h3>
<p>Without the ritual, the myth is no more than a librarian’s relic. But by the ritualistic reproduction of the creational myth (<i>Kumbhaparva</i>) a twelve year long religious circuit that cuts across half of the indian sub-continent comes to life. Just like “rituals everywhere mark especiphic moments in time as they mark the repetitive nature of existence, -astral bodies, which move into the same configurations cyclically, are particularly well suited to the determination of ritual periods.<span id="fnref7"><a epub:type="noteref" href="part1themyth.xhtml#fn7" class="footnote-ref"><sup>7</sup></a></span>” Every ritual is both a time unit and the symbolic renewal of the cosmos. That is to say in words of the famous religious studies academic, Mircea Eliade “A Cosmos that is alive, strong, fruitful and capable of periodic renewal. To renew the world is equivalent to <i>reconsacrating</i> it, to making it again as it was <i>in principio</i>, and sometimes this <i>reconsecration</i> has the value of a return to the paradisiacal stage of the world.”<span id="fnref8"><a epub:type="noteref" href="part1themyth.xhtml#fn8" class="footnote-ref"><sup>8</sup></a></span> In other words the heart beat of a timeless civilization with a (cosmic) rhythm of its own.</p>
<p>In spite of the auspicious element of been in the center of the (symbolic) universe the mere presence of the individual might be enough to get the favors of the ritual. It is necessary to attend with a proper state of mind; therefore from center to center, these circuits have to be transited. In order to access the sacred spots there is the need to physically get there. Only then, the experience of the sacred (<i>hierophany</i>) or act of ‘seeing’ (<i>Darshan</i>, in hindu religious thought) can be performed. Thus, a preamble is added to the ritual, the religious-oriented journey from one place to another: the <i>Pilgrimage</i>. From the comfort of the house-home to the holy centers this territorial displacements are already an act of devotion.</p>
<p>Yet, once again; although fundamental, the mere act of “going” does not suffice. It is necessary to undertake the journey as a preparation for the ritual and that sets it far away from any definition of leisure. Being a religious duty it is not supposed to be a pleasant journey. “The road leading to the center is a "difficult road", and this is verified at every level of reality: difficult convolutions of a temple (as at Borobudur); pilgrimage to sacred places (Mecca, Hardwar, Jerusalem); danger-ridden voyages of the heroic expeditions in search of the Golden Fleece, the Golden Apples, the Herb of Life; wanderings in labyrinths; difficulties of the seeker for the road to the self, to the "center" of his being, and so on. The road is arduous, fraught with perils, because it is, in fact, a rite of the passage from the profane to the sacred, from the ephemeral and illusory to reality and eternity, from death to life, from man to the divinity. Attaining the center is equivalent to a consecration, an initiation; yesterday's profane and illusory existence gives place to a new, to a life that is real, enduring, and effective”.<span id="fnref9"><a epub:type="noteref" href="part1themyth.xhtml#fn9" class="footnote-ref"><sup>9</sup></a></span></p>
<div class="contendor">
<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/59296494" width="100%"/>
</div>
<p>Indeed, a significant amount of devotion is required to undertake this religious mandate. Nevertheless, it is not a journey into the unknown. There were the pilgrim walks; he will find the trail of the journeys of their ancestors. Historical-geographical landmarks that not only provide welfare during his strenuous trip but also have the pedagogical function of preparing the mind of the pilgrim through the iconography and symbolism of their images and rituals making the pilgrimage a journey across time.</p>
<p>Every time the celestial bodies go into a particular alignment; millions of people, following the traces of those who are not more, and moving along with the planets and the stars, gather to form the biggest human congregation ever known. By doing this, they exchange diverse goods, news, facts about distant and unknown places, ideas, all (or most of these) coming from a space that is bonded with the legacy of the myth, thus, a sense “of communion and common purpose similar to the collective human bond (1969, pp. 96-97). It can be considered <i>anti-structure</i> (Turner, 1982, p. 44), a transcendence of the daily experience of social structure which, particularly in India, rigidly orders society. Turner further specified that communitas exists on a sort-of continuum: <i>existential communitas</i>, where this feeling of oneness emerges spontaneously; <i>normative communitas</i>, when such spontaneous group cohesion becomes organized into "a perduring social system;" and <i>ideological communitas</i>, which is often a discursive, utopian model by religious or political groups for the optimal conditions to create <i>existential communitas</i>“.<span id="fnref10"><a epub:type="noteref" href="part1themyth.xhtml#fn10" class="footnote-ref"><sup>10</sup></a></span></p>
<h3 class="titp" id="uzdQ2jRz6exZcrNhzsbuqUF">The elusive historicity</h3>
<p>Well in advance and during the bathing dates of the Mela the different State agencies, religious institutions and authorities and the enormous bulk of the attendants of the Kumbh Mela sustained that the 2013 festival on the bank of the Ganges in Prayag was part of a millenarian continuum. The mythical roots of the festival have become an important column in the narratives that link the festival with the pan-hindu identity and the vast cultural legacy of India as a whole. A signature quote from one of the fore-fathers of the contemporary Indian nation, paradoxically more known because of his secularism than form his piety, is almost a mandatory element for any Indian text that speaks about the Mela of Allahabad:</p><p>
</p><div class="poe">
<p>“In my old city of Allahabad or in Haridwar I would go to the great bathing festivals, the Kumbha Mela, and see hundreds of thousands of people come, as their forebears has come for thousands of years from all over India, to bathe in the Ganges. I would remember descriptions of these festivals written thirteen hundred years ago by Chinese pilgrims and others, and even then these melas were ancient and lost in an unknown antiquity.”<span id="fnref11"><a epub:type="noteref" href="part1themyth.xhtml#fn11" class="footnote-ref"><sup>11</sup></a></span></p>
</div>
<p>Written with a prison induced nostalgia, Pandit Jawarahal Nehru the freedom fighter, by portraying his early life experiences as the ‘discovery’ an historically deeply rooted tradition that bonds the pan-hindu tradition together set the ground for labeling the Kumbh Mela as the oldest and holiest festival of India. Yet, this statement should be taken carefully as the celebration of the Kumbh in Allahabad seems to be newer than it’s believed.</p>
<div class="image">
<img class="imgl" alt="nehruatthesangam" src=".../images/nehruatthesangam.jpg"/>
</div>
<p>More academic and historical-linguistic approaches such as the one from Giorgio Bonazzoli claim that while the mythological sources of the Churning of the Ocean of Milk and Garuda’s or Jayanta’s flight into heaven are present in the well know epics of the <i>Mahabharat</i> and <i>Ramayana</i> as well as in numerous Upanishads, there are no Vedic-Puranic records establishing espechiphic locations as such. A rigorous academic with deep knowledge of Sanskrit literature he makes an implacable critic to the mainstream discourse and its alleged Sanskrit sources. Replying to those who use as a far reaching historical source the following verse from the <i>Atharvaveda</i>:</p>
<p class="po">“<i>I give four pitchers (Kumbha) in four different places</i>” Atharvaveda, (4.34.7)</p>
<p>He mentions that: “In a closer examination, it is not difficult to discover how the text has been simply adapted to signify the Kumbh Mela by separating it from the context<span id="fnref12"><a epub:type="noteref" href="part1themyth.xhtml#fn12" class="footnote-ref"><sup>12</sup></a></span>. […] We have to suppose therefore that not even in Sayana’s time such verse was connected with Prayaga and the Kumbh, although in his age <i>Tirthayatras</i><span id="fnref13"><a epub:type="noteref" href="part1themyth.xhtml#fn13" class="footnote-ref"><sup>13</sup></a></span> were very common. So we have to deduce that the previous adaptation is quite recent and possibly restricted to small circles […] Although the interpretation of the scriptures given in a particular epoch by the faithful has to be considered legitimate, yet I doubt how many persons are ready to accept the proposed meaning of the quoted verses, when it is so removed from the original sense of the scriptures”.<span id="fnref14"><a epub:type="noteref" href="part1themyth.xhtml#fn14" class="footnote-ref"><sup>14</sup></a></span></p>
<p>He continues his argumentation, using as a reference “a tradition which is common among people” i.e. the flight of Garuda towards heaven (<i>Visnuloka</i>) with the nectar falling in the four holy places. Claiming that there is no text supporting this katha but is the adaptation of the bardic (oral) tradition which had a very strong influence in medieval India.<span id="fnref15"><a epub:type="noteref" href="part1themyth.xhtml#fn15" class="footnote-ref"><sup>15</sup></a></span> (See Apendix. <a href="apendix.html" id="#back_apendix.html">I The Skanda Purana</a>)</p>
<p>In the same line of though, Miloslav Krasa concedes that there are records underlining the importance of Prayaga as a pilgrimage place in texts as the Rigveda and the Mahabharata but argues that “according to preserved historical evidence, the pilgrimages known as the Kumbha Mela, do not occur earlier than the seventeenth-eighteenth century.”<span id="fnref16"><a epub:type="noteref" href="part1themyth.xhtml#fn16" class="footnote-ref"><sup>16</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Setting aside the Sanskrit debate of the festival, the first documented (and still disputed) sources of an Allahabad Mela would be from the year 643 AC at most. On this occasion the Chinese pilgrim Hsuan Tsang gives the account of a religious festivity attended by Hindus, Jains and Buddhists alike on the banks of the city Prayag. His writings records a festival attended by approximately half a million people and that the Indian King Harsavardhana, his court and other rulers, ascetics, artists, sages and beggars were all regarded as pilgrims alike. During this quinquenal festivity the king would distribute his wealth and possessions among the pilgrims in such a generous way that after 75 days he would back to his palace having only a piece of borrowed cloth.<span id="fnref17"><a epub:type="noteref" href="part1themyth.xhtml#fn17" class="footnote-ref"><sup>17</sup></a></span> Yet, in his memories there is no mention of any “Kumbh” festivity.</p>
<p>The trail towards the origins of the pan-hindu ritual goes up to the time of Adi Shankara or  Shankaraacharya an ascetic philosopher from the 8th century AC which organized “the fragmented sects of hindu ascetics into a single institution [and] to protect caste hierarchy, which he saw as integral to a functional and thriving religious society, Sankara designed an all-encompassing institution that would consolidate the previously dispersed efforts of solitary high-caste renouncers and array them against the combined threats of Buddhism, Jainism, and <i>tantra</i>”<span id="fnref18"><a epub:type="noteref" href="part1themyth.xhtml#fn18" class="footnote-ref"><sup>18</sup></a></span> without jeopardizing the ritual and belief autonomy of the monastic traditions: The <i>Advaita Vedanta</i> system and the <i>Sannyasis</i>. This would have change the nature of the already existing local and ‘single group’ gatherings that were already taking place in Allahabad, shifting them to a pan-ascetic event. However, the lack of historical records undermines the solidity of these claims and suggests, in the same way as Chaitanya in his Charitramrita (1514 CE) and Tulsidas in his <i>Ramacharitmanasa</i> that the event held on the Prayaga Triveni Sangam was instead a ‘Magh Mela’ or a festival that use to take place ‘when the sun enters the constellation of capricorn’.</p>
<p>Finally, the strongest evidence of the un-existence of a Kumbh festival in Allahabad is its absence from the governmental records (whereas there are numerous recording referring to the “Magh” Mela) until 1870 when the Allahabad Magistrate records his negotiations with the Akhara’s representatives regarding the order of the bathing procession that would take place during the Shahi (Royal) Snans of the Kumbh Melas to come (<a href="#box" id="back_box">See Box</a>); this is in close resemblance to the orders observed with the policies taken by the British Government in Haridwar during the previous events<span id="fnref19"><a epub:type="noteref" href="part1themyth.xhtml#fn19" class="footnote-ref"><sup>19</sup></a></span>.</p>
<p>However, for this to come to place a different type of Kumbhyoga had to come into place.</p>
<p>The barhing order of the Akharas was fruit of intense multi-party negotiations between the State and different groups of interest. The agreement was so transcendental for the organization of the Melas that it remains with minimal changes until today.</p>
<p>The Shaivaite akharas have the prime bath starting with the Maha Nirvani and Atal Akharas. They will be followed by the Niranjani, Anand, Juna, Awahan and Agni akharas.</p>
<p>The Vairagi akharas come next with the Nirmohi, Digambar Ani and Nirvani Ani akharas followed by the Udasin Akharas, the Naya Udasin Panchayati and the Bada Udasin Panchayati akharas.</p>
<p>The Nirmala akhara will bring to a close the Shahi snan.</p>
