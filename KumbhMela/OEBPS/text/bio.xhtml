    <p><b>Luis F. Pérez Torner</b> (Ciudad de México, 1984). Originally a anarchist-atheist. Somewhere in the way of achieving his BA in International Relations, Diploma in Theory and History of Religion and an MA in Peace and Development Studies from the Banaras Hindu University a doubt regarding the non-existence of anything began to grew and hadn’t stopped ever since.</p>
    <p>During his time in India, his interest towards faith in movement or pilgrimage, took him to explore the notions of Peace and freedom from the perspective of some of the different ascetic sects that wander around the Indian subcontinent. The tread of that question took him along with dozens of millions of people to take the holy bath in the Kumbh Mela 2013.</p>
    <p>The first or the last one of many, that step forms nowadays the cornerstone of a new way to see and appreciate life. The initiation ritual of a pilgrim.</p>
