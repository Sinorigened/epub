<h3 id="uD2uEvmbh4KxBktEXTwCpLG">The Pilgrims</h3>

</div>
<p>By far, the largest group of actors at the Melas the Pilgrims have remained in an anonymous collectivity since the beginning of the Yatra/Mela history of India. “The term pilgrim, in historical and contemporary usage, emerges as a word loaded with meaning; it connotes an innocent, even ignorant subject who defies all obstacles to perform a religious duty. It is not surprising that when questioned by researchers, many people, implicitly understanding the humble and somewhat subaltern currency of ‘‘pilgrim,’’ define their purpose at any given pilgrimage site as ‘‘tourist’’<span id="fnref20"><a epub:type="noteref" href="part2thepeople.xhtml#fn20" class="footnote-ref"><sup>20</sup></a></span>. Yet, this heterogeneous group (as the pilgrimage is an obligation for all the people regardless of their social status) are far away from the notion of tourist in both mediums and objectives. In the Magh or Kumbh tradition a especiphic group of them are defined by the word Kalpavaasi. The seeker for immortality (<i>Kalp</i> referring to the sum of the four Yugas which in the Sanskrit tradition sums millions of solar years). In order to achieve that a deliberate act of withdrawal or renunciation has to take place. This withdrawal from life can take many forms, from leaving the home to live in the forest and/or enduring severe austerities avoiding having a roof over their head, to the renunciation of all their possessions through the distribution of alms, or limiting their alimentation to the minimum during the entire period of the Magh (i.e. from moon to moon).</p>
<h3 id="uLuo5AKhUt7fWHZWJVDAVI2">The Prayagwals</h3>
<p>The Prayagwals, as there are commonly know, are the priests (Pandits) in charge of performing and regulating the numerous rituals at Prayag. The agency of these Brahmins dates from generation as it’s a charge which is inherited from father to son since time immemorial according to the vedic-puranic tradition. A relatively recent legend dates from the Mughal reign of the emperor Akbar and its related to the Sangam contemporary landscape.  According to the legend<span id="fnref21"><a epub:type="noteref" href="part2thepeople.xhtml#fn21" class="footnote-ref"><sup>21</sup></a></span> the construction of the fort in Allahabad was been jeopardized by the erosion of the heavy waters of the confluence of the two (maybe three) rivers which were washing away the foundations of the fortified walls. One of his advisers suggested the emperor that the sacrifice of a Brahmana would tame the wild flow of the Yamuna River. The victim accepted the emperor’s designation but demanded in exchange that his descendants would remain the official performers of the rituals that were performed for time being.</p>
<p>Centuries after the descendants of this martyr became hundreds of families that after consolidating their presence in the banks of the Ganga-Yamuna-Saraswati junction dispersed around the sub-continent and established a net-work which would visit villages all around India promoting the Melas, praising the blessings given to those who attend the rituals, and offering their services for when the time come in exchange of a certain amount of money. Originally, the relation forged by the Panda and the pilgrim’s family was kept though generation hence, upon his arrival, the pilgrims would open a detailed archive regarding their lineage, status and claims of land ownership which would then be carefully kept in <i>Bahis</i>. Book like records whose credentials were such that they could be used as evidence in court cases should any dispute arise.<span id="fnref22"><a epub:type="noteref" href="part2thepeople.xhtml#fn22" class="footnote-ref"><sup>22</sup></a></span>

</div>
<p>Knowers of the intricacies of the rituals of the Sangam and keepers of the genealogic and economical legacy of thousands of families around India, the Prayagwals became a group of interest by its own and as such they reserved the rights of preserving the tradition (by the interpretation of the sacred texts), collecting the donations of the devotees and in occasions speaking on behalf of their clientele around the country: a religious and cuasi-political guild that was in crash course with the modern bureaucratic system.</p>
<h3 id="uuqCMfx9s27xZv4LMUpzsb5">The Sadhus</h3>
<div class="image">
<img class="imgh" alt="saddhusonprocesion" src=".../images/saddhusonprocesion.jpg"/>
</div>
<p>The term Sadhu or Sannyasi can be translated as ‘renouncer’. The ones who have left (or rose in denial) of the bondages of the social life. Heirs of a millenarian tradition, these Indian ascetics have criss-crossed the sub-continent since immemorial times. The first written record regarding them is one of the oldest texts in the Hindu tradition. A set of laws supposed to be written by <i>Manu</i>, the first human, who set their code of conduct:</p>
<div class="poe">
<p>Having performed the Ishti, sacred to the Lord of creatures (Prajapati), where he gives all his property as the sacrificial fee, having reposited the sacred fires in himself, a Brahmin may depart from his house as an ascetic.</p> 
<p>For that twice-born man, by whom not the smallest danger even is caused to created beings, there will be no danger from any quarter after he is freed from his body.</p> 
<p>Departing from his house fully provided with the means of purification (Pavitra), let him wander about absolutely silent, caring nothing for enjoyments that may be offered to him.</p> 
<p>Let him always wander alone, without any companion, in order to attain final liberation, fully understanding that the solitary man, who neither forsakes nor is forsaken, gains his end. </p>
<p>He shall neither possess a fire nor a dwelling; he may go to a village for his food, [but] he shall be indifferent to everything, firm of purpose, meditating and concentrating his mind on Brahman.</p>
</div>
<div class="fi">
<p class="ri">The Laws of Manu (6.39-43)<span id="fnref23"><a epub:type="noteref" href="part2thepeople.xhtml#fn23" class="footnote-ref"><sup>23</sup></a></span></p>
</div>

<p>The initiation is also considered a symbolical death, hence other approximation to the sadhus is the ones ‘who are already dead’ o the ones ‘who are twice born’ comes from the fact that this renunciation cuts across material, social and ontological spheres of the ascetic life. For them the constraints of the life in society and even the ‘embodiment experience’ are apparent in the best of the cases. “Throughout their yogic practices, they continue to articulate their realization that life is transitory. Smearing their bodies with sacred ash (<i>vibhuti</i>) is a reminder that the body will, in the passage of time, become ash. Displays of indifference to pain-lying on thorns, wearing spiked shoes, enduring extremes of heat and cold, performing incredible feats of penile strength, or otherwise deforming the body (all of which can be seen at the Kumbh)—proclaim their transcendence from bodily sensations. Sadhus are, as a result of these life-denying austerities, inherently powerful beings, capable of bestowing blessings on the pilgrims who seek their audience.”<span id="fnref24"><a epub:type="noteref" href="part2thepeople.xhtml#fn24" class="footnote-ref"><sup>24</sup></a></span></p>

</div>
<p>However, here lies an evident tension between the ever solitaire wanderer being the iconic figure of the biggest human gathering in the world. Originally the ascetic was exactly the counter-position of the Bhramanical house-holder system that governed the traditional Indian society (although we are compelled to underline that according to Manu, both of them were different stages of a righteous life [Manu. IV. 37]) thus, socially isolated and economically marginal.</p>
<p>However, although periferical, the renouncer institution enjoyed the recognition from the rest of the traditional society as it was regarded as a legitimate (and sometimes even desirable) path in life. This made the figure of the wanderer a veritable alternative space within the ancient Indian social map for those who for some reason or another were not able to find a place inside the rigid caste system. With the passing time, the robes became a symbol of a search for wisdom and a escape route for outcasts, fugitives, madmen, and women escaping from hostile environments.</p>
<div class="image">

</div>
<p>However the ascetic tradition of India, while having managed to remain alive though out the dramatic history of the sub-continent has also been subject to changes and adaptations to the changing conditions of their surroundings.</p>
<p>As we mentioned before, one of the most dramatic transformation of this tradition was the instauration of the <i>Advainta Vedanta</i> (non-dualistic) system of Sankaracarya which “[catalyzed] the gradual progression from the solitary renouncer life into institutionalized renunciation, thereby radically altering Indian monastic history. Not only did he establish four regional centers for the administration of religious affairs in India which remains in place today, led by four regional chiefs known [also] as Sankaracaryas in their own right, but […] he established ten structured lineages for renouncers, which he named the dasnami sampradayas, the ‘Orders of the Ten Names’”.<span id="fnref25"><a epub:type="noteref" href="part2thepeople.xhtml#fn25" class="footnote-ref"><sup>25</sup></a></span></p>
<p>The system also developed the Akhara or Akhada institutional layer to which latter were added new ones according to their traditional systems (including some sects of the Sikh tradition know as the Udasin Akhara in the XVIIth century) and numerous sub-divisions that nowadays present a deliberate intricate net-work<span id="fnref26"><a epub:type="noteref" href="part2thepeople.xhtml#fn26" class="footnote-ref"><sup>26</sup></a></span> whose categorization fall beyond the reach of the present work.</p>
<p>During these days of ‘Buddhist Hooliganism’ (as described by contemporary ascetics) this philosophical political and quasi military system became the lying stone of the wanderer community and an institutional (though, peripherical) framework which provided the ground for this ragged men to become social, political and military actors in their own right. Having a newly acquired sense of identity fostered by the holy mission of protecting the Hindu religion from the expansion of the ‘invaders’ religious though, the former hermits began to form nomadic groups which would move from one holy place to the other across the sub-continent. The remnants of this orders and institutions are still present today and still play a fundamental role in the rituals and organization of the festival as well as have a predominant place in the <i>Dharma Sansan</i> (or religion parliament).</p>

<p>The religious events also represented a good opportunity for exchanging goods. The holy men became venturous traders which travelled the pilgrimage circuits also as trading routes. Travelling across ancient India was certainly not an easy task, besides the natural hazards of the routes, the human element of bands of thieves gave the Sadhus the chance of becoming battle hardened and the martial element was included. Spiritual role models, wealthy traders and recognized warriors; the Sadhus progressively acquired power until their zenith with the advent of the British in the XVIIIth century.</p>
<h3 id="uuEuZzjkdIDHRY6NMb2XV76">Banaras: The last destination</h3>
<div class="image">
<img class="imgh" alt="melainbanaras" src=".../images/melainbanaras.jpg"/>
</div>
<p>From the very beginning my ascetic informants were clear to mention that although it is considered merituos to remain in the holy banks of the Ganga-Yammuna-Sarasvati the religious duties of the Akharas were specified only to the three Royal Baths the next Sadhu highlight been Peshwai Procession through the gates of the Holy City on the 28th of February 2003. The akharas would then remain in the Ghats until Maha Shivaratri on the 10th of March were they would participate in the last Asnan.</p>
<p>Many of the attendants and service providers were aware of this and framed their projection accordingly either by agending their departure previous to the official closure of the festival or by speciphic rate for the ‘high’ and ‘low season of the Mela. Meanwhile, the people and the service providers in Banaras were holding preparations for the festival with quite in advance preparations. While looking for a long term accommodation in the month of October, landlords and guest-house owners would usually include the potential profit of the Mela season in their negotiation; others, who had to deal with the low influx of tourism during the last semester of 2012 would find relief in the explanation of a ‘Kumbh Mela vacuum’ meaning that the tourist wave was ‘holding it’s horses’ in order to attend the festival and the following Kumbh in Varanasi. And they did, profiting with 100% occupancy at 5 or six times the normal rates of the year. The crowds, on their slow process of leaving the Mela would pass through Banaras as the last point of their pilgrimage to the Kumbh. Besides the geographical proximity between the two holy places (120 Km. or a four hour bus drive) this also has an explanation within the symbolic landmarks of Kashi were “Prayag is said to be contained in both Prayaga Ghat and Panchganga Ghat, and Hairdwar is said to be at Asi Ghat, where pilgrims are encouraged to imagine the Kumbh at times by the placement of ‘low wooden chakis where the riverside vendors and priest are, stacked high with kumbhas, the fat clay waterpots, representing the kumbha of old which held the nectar of immortality. This strategy clearly enjoys some success, as evidenced by the crowds bathing in Varanasi in 2001 during the month of Magh”<span id="fnref27"><a epub:type="noteref" href="part2thepeople.xhtml#fn27" class="footnote-ref"><sup>27</sup></a></span></p>
<p>The storm that hit the Mela grounds on the 16th and 17th of February fostered the departure scheduled for the Magh Purnima aftermath. By the 18th February the lively structures of the camps along the boulevards of the sector 4 were dismantled and within hours transferred to the river banks in Varanasi. The slow pace of the gaths was flooded with the permanent ripple of mantras, bayans and handcraft developing works done by young Sadhus preparing the camps for their gurus to come. The former open area next to the river steps became an intricate set of alleys and the bare stone became converes with tens, paroles, and small stalls, just like an avant garde of the world that was about to disappear in Allahabad.</p>

</div>
<p>There was a perceived (and maybe subjective) difference nevertheless. While the Kumbh Mela as a city on its own at Allahabad, the plastic and poles lane that stretched from Panchganga Ghat to Assi and the millions of pilgrims that attended it were guests in an urban center with a strong identity and own dynamics. The dhunis, momentarily run by young apprentices became more proactive in their search for devotees and the opportunity to smoke a chillum displaced the darshan as the main reason for visiting the camps. Suddenly, the precondition of adventure and austerity of the ritual was gone, hence the ambience left its pristine ritualistic feeling and the interactions among pilgrims, ascetics and causal onlookers became oriented by more worldly concerns. The dream was coming to an end.</p>
