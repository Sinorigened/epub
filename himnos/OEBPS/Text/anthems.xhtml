    <p>Losing your iPod is a mistake barely comparable to that of losing your passport —it relies on both items that your travel get to happen. You’re just having a feeling about that in the departure lounge at the airport, even if you haven't used a passport before this day/ in which you have the sense that nothing has been your choice: You didn’t choose to spend the Easter break traveling to Toronto in order to see your father,/ you neither choose the dreadfully scheduled departure time: At 6 in the morning. It wasn’t your choice either to hold in your hands your sister’s old walkman/ with a heap of cassette tapes from bands you barely know and take up half of the backpack. You resolve/ that previously unheard music is definitely better than the airport racket/ and while you’re waiting for the boarding announcement, you uncurl the headphones and pick the band you will listen to with the only valid criteria before so many unknowns: the euphony of a name: Violent Femmes, Sonic Youth, New Order, Elvis Costello, Jeff Buckley, Tom Waits, Joni Mitchell, The Smiths, Talking Heads, The Velvet Underground, Television, My Bloody Valentine, Dinosaur Jr. What is it supposed to sound like a group called Violent Femmes? Is it irony a pice of old junk tagged Sonic Youth? If only fate would have slipped in your backpack tapes by bands you actually know. Throughout the small hours your iPod didn’t show up so it was your mother who, minutes before leaving, suggested a jump back in time that involved searching in the wardrobe for the tapes your sister collected during her high-school year in Los Angeles. You go for The Smiths with more compliance than eagerness. You stare at the walkman with bewilderment and use it following your instinct— you don't even know if it will work. You place new batteries and introduce Louder than Bombs unaware if a massacre or a wonder would follow. You don’t know how to react/ to the white noise at the start of the tape— is it a breakdown, a volume malfunction, or an intentional delay? Just before the sound of Johnny Marr’s guitar playing that open wide E chord, you get to hear outside those fat headphones, an impersonal woman’s voice announcing your flight to Toronto.</p>
<h1 id="usliQH5HpR4A2erfPNkvYl9">2</h1>
<p>From Mexico City to Chicago, the landscapes from half of the subcontinent remained behind a closed curtain: a fat, gray-haired gringo preferred to sleep through the whole flight. What did he took a window seat then? You pay for stuff like this —for watching cities turned into school mockups, crumpled papers that are mountain chains, you pay for the geometric shadow drawn on the streets by buildings  and clouds that cover wide fields traced with such care you had never got close while sketching graphs at math class. You wanted to read but kept on dozing on every single page —even Stephen King can get to be supremely boring when turned into a school reading. You weren’t able to watch the whole of at least one single movie, as if everything would have to say something important to be worth. It says you’re turning equally half cynical, half naive— something that is often removed by the years, you grow up, become less unbearable, but there are other cases that turn cynical and naive forever, like your father. She can be a nagging bitch sometimes —she knows that nothing hits your bollocks more the being compared to your dad.</p>
<p>Chicago was not very different from the flight —there was a lake outside and the humongous skyscrapers but you had to ask a guard that was more interested in his nachos than visitors like you. During a six hour stop you wandered through wide duty-free aisles.</p>
<p>So many a time you read about heroic voyages, dangerous expeditions reaching unknown continents, languages never heard before or at least sober, but not less important. self-discoveries.   A travel to remember relies on tests, riddles, mosquito-spread diseases; conversely, you can only argue that English is, against all odds, satisfactory and know already the gift you’ll get your mother on the way back home. One hour before your flight departure you decide to give The Smiths another chance.</p>
<div class="grid">
<img alt="SMITHS-600PX" src="../Images/SMITHS-600PX.gif"/>
</div>
<p>Finally, you listen to that Marr chord that so many people judge brilliant and seems to you a loud but simple beginning. You love Morrissey’s voice but the lyrics fail to get your attention. You move your feet to the rhythm of the bass drum but are not excited. You remember your mother’s criticism and secretly acknowledge her: A few days up here you are worried that every movie and every book (even those considered bad by others) should make an statement for you about a fact that is both important and ignored; and even if it’s been a while since you are unable to watch a movie with your mother without drawing attention to her criminal tastes, your comforted believing that your loathing has motivations: life is boring, your first journey abroad is protocol and paperwork plenty  but devoid of emotion. Thats why you search for stuff that says something about life: you assume that yours is important, but sometimes the reasons to state it categorically  escape from you. Does this song tell you anything?</p>
<h1 id="uLlEqtmuB2kBBHwK3wSpJWG">3</h1>
<p>“I can’t believe it, you’re taller than me already”.
<br/>“I’ve been taller than you for two years”.</p>
<p>Bad new beginning. You don’t have a reason to underline the fact that you haven’t met in so long a time. Divorce wasn’t catastrophic —even though your mother speaks ill of your father all the time, you know it is only because she’s still in love with him. You know, too, that he went to Canada after becoming jobless in Mexico. You respect his work, you like that he’s even recognized for it, but you don’t want to be a historian like him anymore. On top of all, you remembered him more tall. Bad new beginning.</p>
<p>Under a cloudy sky both of you go to his house / and he says that that is “your house”, apologizes for being away, beyond the evident geography, and proclaims that you should come more often.</p>
	   <p>“How about soccer?”<br/>
	   “I don’t play anymore.”<br/>
	   “Do you have a girlfriend?”<br/>
	   “We split up months ago.”</p>
	<p>You don’t want to sound impersonal but neither manage to elaborate on anything; you must add the weariness of traveling thousands of kilometers / without a window. Partly, the rest of the night will go on like this. He’s as nervous as you are and his first answer only makes him choose even more carefully each phrase, as anticipating another answer that would prove mutual strangeness. But none of his phrases can anticipate that both of you keep silence.</p>
	<p>You like his wife. She’s younger than your mother but not so young as your sister. May be she’s prettier, but less elegant. You could say exactly the same about the two story building that your father repeatedly call “your house, your new house”. However, you recognize little of your father in it. The magazines and books, that accumulated at his studio through the years (in your house), arranged exclusively by chance and carelessness, now follow a comprehensible order, almost rigorous. The same as the mugs in the cupboard, the pots in the living room, the matching colors of the furniture and the rug. It might be your house, but / not even close/ it belongs to your father.</p>
	<p>His wife cooked a great lasagna “only for your visit” and your father shows you the flat screen and the untouched video game console.</p>
	<p>“This is yours, but there’s another identical, brand new and still packaged that you will be able to take on your way back”.</p>
	<p>He also promise a new iPod and visits to museums and parks and malls and bookstores and historical places and the only thing you have to do now is sleep, get used to your new father —which is a little balder but doesn’t have gray hair yet— to the unsettling cleanness of each room, to his spotless Honda, to his wife’s kindness (which only makes you suspicious), to your thermal clothes, to your room that according to your father is only yours and to probe it signs the Foo Fighters poster on the wall.</p>
	<p>“Claudia choose it”, he explains.</p>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<p>And all of a sudden you don’t like the Foo Fighters anymore.</p>
<h1 id="urhLeHdWSPAdTYojTj2mPE3">4</h1>
<p>You’re dying of tiredness but don’t feel sleepy. You listened to the whole cassette tape by the Smiths. May be the fact that you’re sleeping outside your home country for the first time affected you enough to fall in love with those songs little by little; each track radiated a subtle charm easily mistaken for magic. You turned the tape in order to listen again to that wide open E chord and you were completely hypnotized already. You listened to the entire record over again.</p>
	<p>You have to admit it:<br/>
	from beginning to end,<br/>
	it blow your fucking mind:<br/>
	each song sounded like someone<br/>
	opening with a single kick<br/>
	the doors of your conscience.</p>
	<p>You masturbate thinking of Taylor Swift or about some of your female classmates and within a few minutes you stain with semen the edge of your bed.</p>
	<p>“Territory marked”, you think proudly before falling asleep while you discover, through the window,  stars different to those of the tropic.</p>
<h1 id="utLgzymtDO2wYP6YFxbYKuE">5</h1>
<p>Cold weather seems to make people kinder; that includes your father, most of all. The change of his   nature is verging on medical enigma: did it only take a temperature decrease to not get angry each other hour? And that same father who never took you on vacation (well, not even to Six Flags) now wants to show you each oddly touristic corner of the city. So much kindness is suspicious.</p>
<h1 id="uPexBdeQjCioEUvJ2qhoWW2">6</h1>
<p>You claimed being sleepy to avoid going with them to the supermarket. You go outside to explore the neighborhood while listening to The Best of… The Smiths. It gets dark so early here, so clean, so organized, so slow the cars go, so expensive a coke can. From this street, downtown big buildings could be perfectly visible but a thick fog prevent seeing anything else than their outlines. The guy from Seven Eleven gives you back a wrong amount of change, so that is the first of many times you will listen “I’m sorry”.</p>
<p>Even the clouds look a bit different. You verify with the touch of your hand that the sudden tickles on the tip of your nose are produced by a snowflake and soon you’re surrounded by falling snow. How can it snow / so easily / up being almost April?</p>
<p>Back at home you steal a cigarette from your father and go out to smoke it in the porch while staring at the very first snowfall of your life.</p>
<h1 id="uItJWseabKhUWCJqITHQqf3">7</h1>
<p>Your father’s friends’ house is not far from here. They’re barely parking the car when Albert and Anne are already waiting for them at the gate, displaying smiles that are undoubtedly sincere though   less warm than any Mexican’s smile.</p>
<p>“Pasa, por favor” they tell you in a lousy but strained Spanish / after introducing themselves and misspelled your name: the say “Undress” instead of “Andrés”, once inside the house the same misspelled name is repeated by Matt, the little brother, and by Claire, the middle sister —but Sarah, the eldest sister, barely mutters “Hi”.</p>
<p>The Thompsons are actually nice and, without a question, take an effort to be likable. They ask you about Mexico, about drug trafficking, if you have already been to some place or have passed by some other street; they ask wether you like Toronto or not and, specially, if you consider to come back here. At this point you can’t take your eyes out off Sarah who, opposite from her initial greeting, has turned out to be quite nice. That she doesn’t drop an occasional phrase in Spanish seems the most welcoming gesture you have received during the whole trip.</p>
<p>While the old guys play cards and the youngsters, you talk with Sarah about books. It’s quite evident that she’s read more than you but isn’t eager to assert it, even when she doesn’t share your taste: While you live for Sci-Fi she has spent moths in love with something called “dirty realism”. How can it be possible that being the same age she uses words that you’d rather hope to hear from your parents?</p>
<p>In her bedroom she shows you her modest yet thorough LP’s collection; some seventies relics borrowed from her parents, some new records.</p>
<p>“That is one of my favorites”, she says as you hold a Smiths vinyl in your hands.</p>
<p>You hesitate wether lying or asserting that The Smiths belong to your own private Olympus, but you guess she will know that’s not true. </p>
	<p>“I began listening to them quite recently, but I like them, I like them a lot”.<br/>
	“So, you have never seen Morrissey alive? I went to one of his concerts recently, and it was amazing”.<br/>
	“No. I don’t know if he has gone to Mexico?”<br/>
	“You should see him. Do you want to play that record?” and she points the turntable.<br/>
	“Better put the record on yourself.”<br/>
	“No way, go on.”<br/>
	“Well, I have never used a turntable.”<br/>
	“Never?”<br/>
	“Never.”</p>
	<p>Inside your head you add that the last thing you expected from such a developed country was that people introduced you into a technological novelty supposedly outdated decades ago.</p>
	<p>“Wow”, she shouts staring at you as if you were from outer space: “I will have to teach you, I suppose. Alright, we’d rather start with this one that I bought this morning”, so she shows you a record that, for a change, you don’t know: You Forgot it in People, by Broken Social Scene. She figures out your disregard and, before you drop your first lie, tells you:</p>
	<p>“You don’t know them, do you?”<br/>
	“No.”<br/>
	“Well, it seems today you’ll learn a lot.”</p>
	<p>She puts the record on with a series of frankly pretentious gestures, at the same time she intones lines from a post-apocalyptic movie that, luckily, you saw last summer:</p>
	<p>“Today is an important day. I found this old radio / and it seems to work. People from another time used to listen to music on it. Like the music your mother sings. People used to record music on this tiny cases called cassettes / so you could be able to play it at the other side of the world / as if they were playing only fro you. Those were important people, of course, and they were famous, their pictures were everywhere and people used to sing along and listen to their songs all around the world as if they were anthems. Listen: This is the music”.</p>
	<p>For the first time<br/>
	you listen to the shriek of the speaker<br/>
	right when the needle touches the surface of the record.</p>
	<p>A hypnotic keyboard comes into play and you sit on Sarah’s bed, not without some embarrassment. She throws herself into the couch, staring at the ceiling, and rises her head to mention that within few days Broken Social Scene is having a small concert.</p>
	<p>“You could come with me, if you want.”</p>
	<p>Some quick and sharp guitars sound through the speakers with, you must admit, frightening clarity. But you are unable to pay lots of attention: A girl just asked you out for a concert. A girl just asked you out for a concert; besides, she’s quite a beauty. As well as so many things right today, this had never ever happened to you.</p>

 <h1 id="uFnWhCMQw47PopVN9yHUgS3">8</h1>

<p>“It was lucky the topic didn’t come out over dinner”, your father tells Claudia at the car, on the way back home.
	<br/>“Actually, even though I already knew, I couldn’t recognize him. How could he change so much in a year? And how could they allow it so easily? I’m not against or anything, but I doubt it was the best time.  What if he regrets it later?”
	<br/>“Do you think he will regret it?”
	<br/>“I don’t know, but it’s adolescence: By definition one is confused at that age.”
<br/>“What are you talking about, dad?”
	<br/>“Sarah”
	<br/>“What about her?”
	<br/>“Didn’t you notice anything awkward about her?”</p>
<p>The real doubt reflected on your face / reflected itself, on the rear-view mirror / is plenty of answers.</p>
	<p>“She was called Rick one year ago”.
	<br/>“¿Como?”, you ask in Spanish believing you just misheard.
	<br/>“Como lo oíste”, he answers in the same language. “Sarah is a boy. I supposed you noticed.”
	<br/>“No.
	<br/>Not at all.”
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>And this had ever happened to you, neither.</p>

 <h1 id="u5pfUfGdgCfa6ElRCPyfXrA">9</h1>
<p>It’s hard to ask about it without seeming too concerned. Barely an hour ago that… boy? with breast and wide hips and long blond hair seemed to you one of the most beautiful girls you ever talked to.</p>
	<p>Of course, you liked her.</p>
	<p>You liked the looks of her thighs inside those leggings and the shape of her waist under her green loose shirt and the way she talked to you and her musical taste and her odd books and all of a sudden, all of it caused you a strange kind of disgust for all the time you were talking to a guy like your friends, like your male cousins, like your former soccer teammates, like all those persons that can grow a beard and speak with a deep voice and take a pee standing up.</p>
	<p>How could you not notice?</p>
	<p>“That’s right. Back when we met him, he was Rick. A normal boy, I suppose, you know, like you. He went to Saskatoon for a year and came back like this. I was surprised so much as you when he came back and I noticed his new shape. I guess I’d never met a person like that ever before.”</p>
	<p>“Neither I.”</p>

 <h1 id="uI94OSrMKPtFX9q5pM2olaF">10</h1>
<p>You walk through the neighborhood in the morning. Examining carefully each centimeter covered by snow: the branches on the tress, the windshield wipers  on the cars, the rooftops, the mail boxes, the sidewalks. You listen to Sonic Youth on the headphones and, though they’re far from being your favorite band, they please you. It’s not so good as the New Order tape that you listened to at breakfast, but is way better than the Tom Waits cassette tape which you found useful only to get asleep. You like the distortion, you like the speed of the drums and the amount of noises, plane / and simple noises, covering each gap on the signal and, for reasons unknown, that fall without effort on your definition of music. You’re sure to have seen a Sonic Youth LP amongst Sarah’s records, which  by now doesn’t cause you the same awkwardness as the day before anymore. Simply, you don't like her anymore / or at least you can’t like her, you tell yourself, because at heart he’s a boy. However, you might decline her invitation; you’re embarrassed still.</p>
<div class="grid">
<img alt="WALKMAN-GIF" src="../Images/WALKMAN-GIF.gif"/>
</div>
 <h1 id="uKyRf5HU7xCovdqMFtNBMAD">11</h1>
<p>At first, you hesitated to accept Sarah’s Facebook request, but you spent a whole hour looking at her pictures.</p>
<h1 id="uwwOi33GqcCIKbh5lq2mDaC">12</h1>
<p>“So, do you already know what you wanna do with your life?”</p>
<p>As a general rule, when that question is asked with that cautionary yet unconcerned tone, it has a built-in contempt. As if your father, who right at this moment can’t decide what to have for dinner at the turkish restaurant with the worst sight and better reputation in the city, would know what he’s doing with his life; as if for years he would have known why he left your mother, as if he new how did he get to bankrupt his press house, as if he knew how did he ended up here in Canada.</p>
<p>“I have no idea”, you lie.</p>
<p>Whatever career you choose, you might study here in Toronto and live with them. You almost explain that you’d never live in Canada but this isn’t about turning the night into a tragedy.</p>
<p>Back home, you call your mother on the phone. Distance turns her into someone understanding: She asks you not to piss your father off so much, but the same distance also makes her melancholic, and right when you tell her about the episode at the restaurant she tells you to weight the offer up — and you understand that she’s actually begging you to do exactly the opposite. Anyway, you just don’t picture yourself living in that house which feels like an hotel.</p>
<p>You play a couple of chess games with your father before going to sleep. You still lose at critical moments. After some well thought plays and tight strategies you leave the last plays in the lurch.</p>
<p>“Why did you come so far away?”</p>
<p>Besides amazement, your father’s face reflexes ignorance rather than doubt. He moves a rook towards an unprotected bishop.</p>
<p>“Because I had the feeling that there was nothing left for me in Mexico.”
<br/>“So, has it been worth?”
<br/>“Sometimes it has, sometimes is hasn’t. When I think of Claudia, I’m sure it has. When I think of you and your mother, I’m sure it hasn’t been worth.”
<br/>“I had no idea you think of her.”
<br/>“Neither I. And I don’t do it the way you think so.”
<br/>“But you do.”
<br/>“I do it because now I know that everything would have settle by itself somehow, If I had stayed. And that’s not only about your mother, includes my job. But I learnt that from Claudia. She’s the youngest daughter of an Uruguayan exile who ended up here rather by chance than by choice. And when he had an opportunity to go back, he knew no longer what for neither had plenty of reasons to stay here. Then Claudia was born. And I think about you, for example: I no longer have a lot to teach you or a lot to tell you, besides to take care of your mother and not to leave your fucking clothes on the floor or not to smoke at the gateway for the neighbors here don’t look favorably upon a boy your age smooking. Don’t believe I don’t find out about it. What else can I say? I had to come all over here to learn all of it.”
<br/>“Does it mean you might go back?”
<br/>“Precisely not so. What I mean is that I couldn’t do that precisely now. Son, Claudia is pregnant, and that’s very important for me, so it’s also important to let you know as you’re being told about this before anyone else.”</p>
<h1 id="uI4BxudxHAMMEcgv7RInomD">13</h1>
<p>After two days texting each other, a meeting with Sarah was unavoidable. Both of you take a bus to the other side of town only for burgers and on the way there she becomes the best tourist guide ever, the one / that only points the locations that matter for her, one that tells apart Toronto’s visitable side from its private side: The record store, the bar where nobody ever ask for her ID, the park where she ice-skates in winter.</p>
<p>Sometimes you don’t pay attention, browsing her gestures/ or her features/ looking for a smack of Rick instead. However, even her hands are completely feminine, quite smaller than yours, her nails covered with lime green polish. She ignores that you know about Rick and you’d like to ask her about it and make up your mind but you’re afraid of being rude. You’re very careful with her, saying to yourself, for she’s the nicest person you’ve met in Toronto. If she treats you like an equal, like the mature boy you claim to be, then why couldn’t you treat her like the woman she seems?</p>
<p>Both of you walk through a park to get to the burger place where her friends are awaiting, talking about videogames and already making plans to play Call of Duty, may be even tonight. Halfway of a long stone pavement road, the trees display branches plucked by winter and the lawn begins to show shyly under the remains of the last snowfall. She describes the way she got to finish Call of Duty on veteran level with a graphic description: she shapes a machine-gun with her arms and shoots every single imaginary enemy surrounding her. She suddenly hugs you, hiding her head in your chest and, following the local code, apologizing. A boy, barely gazing at both of you, pass behind her. You don’t respond to her hug but still enjoy the scent of her hair.</p>
<p>“He used to be a friend from school.”
<br/>“I thought he was something more of an ex boyfriend.”
<br/>“No way! Before I went to Saskatoon he was a good friend of mine, that’s it.”</p>
<p>You know that asking why did they stop being friends may take the conversation to unsuitable ground, so you barely mutter that you understand and both of you keep going.</p>
<p>Five Guys burgers were more than amazing and you got along with Sarah’s friends, Julia and Nick. Would you ever imagined that some green haired stud packed punks could actually be so harmlessly likable? The ask if you’re gonna go with them to the Social Broken Scene concert, this Friday, and you say yes though you don’t hesitate to ask first if they like that band. It seems that this rock band you barely know has a cult following among the kids in this town and, as soon as Julia affirms how much she likes them, Nick barges in to tell everyone about his encounter with Kevin Drew, the singer in the band, at some beach in Oaxaca. Of course, the conversation lead them to talk about how much they love your country. They can’t believe you have never witnessed a gun-fight neither you have a single drug-dealer among your acquaintances.</p>
<h1 id="uh8uMFx9zVPpEpfMxaCPmF9">14</h1>
<p>Your head is full of lyrics by The Smiths these days. You confess it to Sarah at a small record store near home, as you find a worn-out copy of Louder than Bombs.</p>
<p>“The same happened to me when I heard it for the first time. Don’t believe I’m being pretentious: It was just last year that I started listening to them. But I understand you. I couldn’t figure out anything happening to me / neither anything I was living / and those songs carry me along.”</p>
<p>So you tell her —on the way back home, among cold weather that’s soaking through until it reaches every single sensitive inch of your body while she’s barely encouraged by it to put the scarf around her neck— that you feel sort of the same right now. People thinks you are convinced that you know everything when in fact you clearly realize everyday that deep down you know just a few things, you know that you broke-up with a girl you spend a year with, and that it still hassles you knowing she’s now dating an old friend of yours, that you don’t know how to speak with your father anymore, and that you don’t know how to feel about his soon-to-be-born baby.</p>
<p>She touches up your arm and you seem to feel the faint warmth of her bare palm going through your jacket’s fibers. In the same way that, back in Mexico City, once the rain is gone Toronto’s night is unusually  clear right at that moment and you can make out the stars with a sharpness measurable in terapixels. Both of you chat about Discovery Channel, of TV shows explaining atomic exchange and how your body totes around particles from every object it touches. You know how to explain that because  you’d like to get a degree on it someday, but when she asks what draws you to Physics you answer, automatically, that you just ignore it. Yet, you add later that you like the way things / at the subterranean world of electrons / are never wholly made up: God plays dice/ and there’s plenty phenomena that has to cross the frontier of chance before becoming real in the form of friction, electromagnetism, elements, structures, objects, or a person. The idea is somehow inaccurate but pleasant: The disposition of the elemental particles that we are made of lack of an apparent direction and therefore all of you yourselves are a consequence of chance.</p>
<p>“You’re the very first person I know that can turn Physics into sweet nothings”, she says as she rubs up her hand against my arm again, just a little bit slower now.</p>
<h1 id="uuhTBQy6GsmHlnH4djXaD2F">15</h1>
<p>Let’s face it: You like Sarah. You like her ways and how she treats you, you like her for the way she smashed you in Call of Duty, and you liked that she lend you her Douglas Coupland book and another by Tobias Wolff. You like the way her hair looks under a red cap and you like the way her legs look as she walks in a pair of boots as high as her knees. You like the fact that she reads so much and you like that she knows how to pronounce your name. You like that she enjoys football. You like the brown spot she has over the grayish iris on her left eye. You like the thickness of her lips and the length of her eyelashes. You liked the beer she offered and the joint both of you smoked before you went back home. You liked her posters and her turntable and her record collection. Her booty makes you go crazy.</p>
<p>But you don’t like liking her.</p>
<p>You don’t like to know about Rick and you don’t like searching for an aftertaste of masculinity in her expressions, her features, her body’s proportions at every time. You didn’t like her taking a pill with a brutal British punctuality, claiming it was a birth control pill as you think it is an hormone pill. You don’t like that her parents and brothers call her an affectionate gender neutral nickname. You don’t like to think of the pictures stored in some wardrobe at her house, of all the pictures where Rick exists, all of the evidence of Rick, people that met Rick, that spent time with him, people that loved him, the things he said or done. You don’t like to wonder where the Sarah name came from. You din’t like to feel that both of you were on a date at moments. You didn’t like almost anything of what you found out in Google. You don’t like that so many words in Spanish requiere a gender and sometimes in your head those words are male. You don’t like being unable to remain unconcerned of her scent and you don’t like the rack you’re upon. You didn’t like to masturbate thinking about her neither wondering if you’re a fag.   You don’t like that most probably she has a penis.</p>

<p>The days when everybody wanted to show you Toronto around and spend every second with you are behind. As soon as all of you came back from the museum, everyone ignored each other completely, no politeness required: Your father locked himself up at his studio, Cluadia went to her parents’ and you keep putting King back to read Life after God instead. It’s not the kind of book you’d buy, but a good one nonetheless. It has been tow days since you went out with Sarah, though you haven’t met or texted too much, you think about her all the time, about the good things and the bad things, and found yourself linking her to more than one of the songs you’ve discovered on your walkman. It would be easier if you could talk about it but between your infinite shyness and the little trust you feel for your friends in Mexico, you choose to speak only with Dinosaur Jr.</p>
<p>Claudia knocks on the door with the phone on her hand: “It’s for you”. At the other side of the landline Sarah asks if your have any plans. She’s bored and in front of a pizza she’d hardly finish on her own.</p>
<p>“Don’t you wanna watch a movie?”</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later both of you are watching Pulp Fiction. She enjoys the dialogues. You enjoy the beatings.</p>
<h1 id="uNybv3PKGgHvSKevBDDuPSE">17</h1>
<p>You made it. It wasn’t unavoidable kissing her. You didn’t have to flirt. Nobody put accidentally a hand over another and no one took the conversation to a rash place. Nobody checked her ass while she went to the bathroom and nobody accept to share a blanket. And, for the record, nobody said goodbye with a kiss on the cheek. You’re a champion, Andrés. You’re a real badass. You pass through a definitive test and now you just have to keep walking. It’s only a few blocks. As soon as you’ll cross the door, you’ll have became a champion, a fucking champion, a fucking champion with blue balls, a fucking champion at being a tremendous douchebag. You made it, Andrés. You made it.</p>
<h1 id="u2wVDRZxeC6BEFEAhKjzyrD">18</h1>
<p>“What time did you arrived last night?”
<br/>“I don’t know. Was it 1:00?”
<br/>“It seems late, isn’t it?”
<br/>“Do you think so?”
<br/>“Quite so. We had breakfast already and you are barely awake. Are you like this with your mother?”
<br/>“I’m on vacation”
<br/>“It doesn’t seem so to me, Andrés”
<br/>“Alright”
<br/>“Is it alright?”
<br/>“Yeah! I get it: Your house, your rules”
<br/>“Precisely because it is my house I don’t want to hear that tone in my house. And don’t go back to bed again: We’ll go bowling with the Thompsons.”</p>
<h1 id="u8xovhPs3Z2teM8Ln8FLdaB">19</h1>
<p>“You told Anne, don’t you?”, says Claudia appealing to that tender form of complaint.
<br/>“I swear I didn’t. I haven’t even talked about it with Albert.”
<br/>“How did she know then?”
<br/>“I don’t know, maybe it’s starting to show”
<br/>“Are you saying I’m getting fat?”
<br/>“I just know some things are impossible to fake”, says your father as his gaze reaches you from the rearview mirror.</p>
<h1 id="uhwFVPmaV3F8FfoFGTsNu9D">20</h1>
<p>In the middle of a slight snowfall, Sarah, you, and about a hundred people stand in line, leaning against a brick wall that leads to a metallic gate.</p>
<p>“Is the concert actually here?”
<br/>“Yes, I swear. This venue is terrific: Here I’ve seen Beach House and The National.”</p>
<p>Would it be too rude to admit you don’t know any of those bands?</p>
<p>“I guess I found some Beach House among my sister’s tapes.”
<br/>“Wow, really? That’s fucking awesome! Especially because Beach House has never released a cassette tape and you’re a dreadful liar.”
<br/>“I don’t know so much about music. Only a week ago, the oldest thing I had ever listened to was was Gorillaz. Don’t you feel a little bit disappointed?
<br/>“Not at all.”
<br/>“But you’ve got me a ticket and took me to the record stores.”
<br/>“And I was aware you had no idea of anything I was saying. Always.”
<br/>“How did you know it?”
<br/>“There are some things you can’t just fake.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, the line began to move. Any moment now, both of you will be few steps away from a band you had never heard of only a week ago, but now it almost is your favorite band. Adrenaline driven, you are compelled to make an abrupt confession to Sarah:</p>
<p>“Are there really things one just can’t fake?”
<br/>“Yes, there are”, she answers automatically, paying attention to the threshold both of you are about to pass through.
<br/>“Well, I’m not sure if you know it, but this will be my ever first concert.”</p>
<p>She turns to look at you with wide opened eyes, as the darkness of the hall you’re getting into covers both of you completely.</p>
<p>“Really?”, she asks using the same tone that someone recently invited to an orgy would.
<br/>“For real.”</p>
<p>And just when you think that inside her head she’s judging you as a boring rookie, she smiles at you with an endless sweetness before saying:</p>
<p>“You make me feel flattered.”</p>
<p>For it must be actually flattering to initiate someone into a ceremony where the only homage is paid to this very moment. As you face the stroboscopic flashlights, the recently smoked marijuana, Sarah’s hand not letting your arm off as both of you dogleg through the crowd on your way to the first row, and that hypnotic keyboard, which sounds perfectly familiar by now, you’re convinced you have arrived late to one of the best things that could ever happen to you in life. Behind the curtain, as it opens like clouds after rain, Broken Social Scene is welcomed with an uproar, which you’re part of without noticing. You’re screaming without noticing. Jumping along with Sarah to the first beats of “KC Accidental”,</p>

<p>your inner ear cells are overpowered with an energy that your brain and language can only decode with the word “ahuevo”.</p>

<p>Sarah smiles to hear your opinion, in your own language, about the only undoubtedly fucking awesome experience                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   you’ve had along this journey that had been, above anything, the journey of first times. For, though you haven’t watched malaria nor have you got lost inside a forbidding cavern / nor have you engaged in trade and war with native tribes/ nor have you gazed at the horizon knowing that cartographers in the future will trace maps based on your adventure, you feel completely like an explorer that goes deep into the phenomenon that some short sighted people plainly call reality, a reality that for the first time unfolds the tip of a wide range of all the tricks and sleight of hands it has preserved just for you all along these 17 years, which all of a sudden is standing in front of you, telling you “I can give you all of this and even more, I can give you things you’ve never thought would be yours, things you never longed for but were always what you needed, I can even give you things that were meant to be only yours”.</p>
<p>Park that car, drop that phone, sleep on the floor, dream about me.</p>
<p>Sometimes particles have no remedy but bond to each other: they form stars, atoms, amino acids, bipeds with extended thumbs, braincells excited by THC and dopamine, eventful bodies among the crowd (and she won't let go off your arm)/ as all of you listen to an anthem.</p>

<h1 id="uveMiF77kpwRXfMWWtpt2mF">21</h1>
<p>There is a time in the life of any young boy when he has to face a frightening door. Toronto or Mexico City, that door is the same: It’s the door of the house where the girl you like lives, just in the moment when you’re about to say good night, goodbye. If she were any other girl, you might be plotting how to kiss her; you’d be fighting to death with paroxysm; you’d be waiting for that good doing  silence to come, that is so favorable to give a first kiss, which almost by definition has to be stolen. But this girl is Sarah, so instead you think thoroughly about how to avoid something that seems just unavoidable.</p>
<p>This is because both of you have had an amazing time tonight and that Broken Social Scene concert will stick in your mind forever, not without reason for it has been your very first concert. Only three hundred feet away from that door, it starts to snow again</p>
<div class="grid">
<img alt="GIF-PARQUE" src="../Images/GIF-PARQUE.gif"/>
</div>
<p>while you talk, a little bit drunk and quite high, about the songs both of you heard, about the buzz inside your head that according to Sarah is caused by your inner ear cells/ howling a frequency you’ll never hear again, about the beer lend by a stranger whom doubtlessly wanted to hit on Sarah, and about the unexpected Feist appearance on stage to sing “Anthems for a Seventeen Year Old Girl”.</p>
<p></p>
<p><i>“Park that car, drop that phone, sleep on the floor, dream about me”</i>, Sarah sings with that quiet, faint voice used by somebody that pretends not wanting to be heard.
<br/>“It sounds like directions”.
<br/>“Directions to get yourself fucked up, Andrés. No less.”
<br/>“But it feels good in the process.”
<br/>Why did you say it?
<br/>“I think so.”</p>
<p>As both of you walk, every time closer to that door, your only wish is for that door to be further  and further away, for this short distance to stretch indefinitely, may be forever, just to walk with Sarah and look back at some point to see your footsteps on the snow, to behold guiltlessly her graceful clumsiness as she walks, and keep on talking about any fucking stupid idea you get. For there is a part of you that doesn’t want to face the deep silence where you might kiss her, and there is another  that simply doesn’t want you to say goodbye. You’re a coward, Andrés. You always were. At your age many men had already built empires and many, thousands more, had already died in the name of those empires. At your age some had sailed away to America, before it was America. At your age some had enough with the every day heroism of feeding more than one mouth. At your age Newton was already Newton and Maradona was already Maradona. At your age some had already written the songs later sang by hundreds of thousands, and some of them just left everything behind to get on a car headed to the verge of nothingness. Conversely, you Andrés, your heroism goes no further than walking high as kite beside a girl you like, being her name Sarah, Laura, Camila, Elizabeth, has she a cunt or a dick or a mussel, your heroism is just not enough; that’s why your ex dumped you and that’s why your friend had the guts to date her, that's why you have never been captain of any team nor will you ever win a fight, and that’s why no one will ever see your name on a Wikipedia article. If those words were actually directions, you should be following them: If you were on a car, you should stop right now; and if you had a cellphone with you, you should drop it right now; if you were sleepy, you should lie on the floor right now and let the sleep do the rest for both of you were always part of the fucked ups, and may be that’s the reason, being no other, why you should be together.</p>
<p>It’s been ages since you lost track of what Sarah is talking about and your hand on her arm makes her tremble as if you were taking her out of an hypnotic trance. She understands you haven’t paid attention for a quite a while and she’s aware of what you’re doing, Andrés, she knows what you’re doing and smiles and that will be the last image you’ll see before closing your eyes, almost exactly in front of that door, as she closes hers.</p>
<h1 id="uCjlli2BGm85Dqdj2FNdygG">22</h1>
<p>You wake up with a hangover, with a bittersweet smile on your face. The night before, on your way back home you followed the footsteps both of you left on the snow. You felt fine, satisfied, as if you had scored a merciful last minute goal on a game you lost. For in your chest there was an pressing heat akin to victory but also to shame. On your walkman a Talking Heads mixtape was playing as you discovered a technological nuisance that marked a whole generation: rewinding the cassette tape to hear the same song once again.</p>
<p>You said goodbye to Sarah with an unsettling spontaneity, without speeches or revelations. Within three days you will be gone and maybe it will be better to leave things as they are — record only what you need: the warmth of her tongue and your hand tracing a little mental map that goes from the edge of her back to her waist. You record, rewind and press play. Heart is a cassette tape.</p>
<p>Claudia went out with her father and to take advantage from it, yours made you go with him to a downtown bookstore and then to have dinner at Five Guys, by your request.</p>
<div class="grid">
<img alt="FIVE-GUYS" src="../Images/FIVE-GUYS.gif"/>
</div>
<p>The foul temper he has kept through the day barely fades away in presence of the smell of meat on the grill. Since the old days when you lived together in Tlalpan neighborhood, before your parents got divorced and your sister got married, dinner time meant a truce against neurosis. He rummages the bottom of a paper bag, looking for the last potatoes fried in peanut oil, as you talk about your sister’s walkman or what it stands for.</p>
<p>“Your mother and I save money for two years to please her that way. It made us glad for those were times when picturing one of my children studying in the United States was equal to an ideological crime. More than one friend began to look at me with suspicion: a former member of the Communist Party sends his daughter  abroad to study with the enemy for a year. Back when I was her age then, I didn’t even like listening to music in English but now I drink coke and work very near the enemy.”</p>
<p>There’s a weather warning on the local radio announcing a winter storm: a snow vortex capable of freezing up Toronto for three days.</p>
<p>“It will be over when you leave. Well, we’ll see. Thank goodness this is April, otherwise you’d stay here for another week at least. The way it is, I got used to the winter storms, not to leave the house for three days in row —without smoking, ah.”</p>
<p>However, this time the cold, the longing or a full belly are not enough to keep your father from allowing himself to get, little by little, carried away by his own nature. As soon as dinner finished he went back to remain silent as he was all through the morning. At the supermarket, at the waiting line of the Seven Eleven, and at every traffic light, you start to recognize in your father that variant of underlying aggression that is very similar to the silence between two countries holding a cold war against each other.</p>
<p>You almost forgot that Sarah would ring your bell at 5 o’clock with a copy of Call of Duty under her arm. You had never  before felt the unyielding weight of your father’s gaze upon your shoulders as you felt it while greeting Sarah with a gesture that will be recorded by the dictionaries as a new definition of clumsiness: a sloppy kiss on the cheek, lacking innocence, so atypical that even she felt awkward and later it would become the cause for the first of many times you’ll say “I’m sorry”.</p>
<p>You’re playing that you play. Pretend to talk. Just a few hours ago you promised yourself to say nothing about it, that for the first time you’d lead your cowardice to carefulness’ grounds. But wasn’t it careless to invite Sarah over?</p>
<p>She’s elegant, almost diplomatic: she presses pause before you riddle her with bullets in the middle of the woods, then leaves the controller on the floor and tell you to remember that nothing has happened:</p>
<p>“I had a good time with you yesterday, you’re a great kisser and that’s what we could keep. I don’t see a cause to tell more than what is necessary.”</p>
<p>You agree to her petition and comply with it for no more than a minute: now you press pause and ask her:</p>
<p>“Why were you saying that it was a set of directions to get yourself fucked up?"<br/>
  “What?”<br/>
  “The song.”<br/>
  Squint, rewind, press play: remember.<br/>
  “The fact that I like sad songs doesn’t mean that I like to be sad or even remember those times when I felt that way.”</p>
<h1 id="uVYCYlZKtYhs4VmfnjkJAJF">23</h1>
<p>“Don’t use that gesture on me as if you didn’t know what I’m talking about. I’m no stupid. I noticed the way you greet each other and the way you saw him. If you like men it’s OK, but don’t fag-whore around at this home.”</p>
<p>Go on, Andrés, you can. You can be as coward as you want, you’re free to do it. Don’t say anything. Nod your head and embrace shame, hold back your tears. Hold back every single word. Hold back everything you can, for right at this moment the record button is being pressed and every detail of this moment will be set in stone, for ever and ever, as that time when your father called you a fag in front of Claudia at dinner. That very moment in which you took yourself back to the unavoidable matter, for as it is said, nature’s logic is dispassionate and when a man kisses another man, he can only be called by an specific word. Get up, Andrés, get up and take to the streets with nothing else but the clothes you’re wearing, get up and take to the streets, let the block and the whole neighborhood know what has just happened. Press the button forcefully and rewind, rewind, rewind this moment.</p>
<h1 id="uM9XFjOoz2xcNjYLeU3wUS5">24</h1>
<p>“What are you doing here? And why are you not wearing a jacket?”<br/>
  “It’s just…”</p>
  <p>That way, Andrés, go on that way.</p>
  <p>“Come in, please, come in and tell me what’s going on.”</p>
  <p>Accept the jacket Sarah is offering you.</p>
  <p>Hide your head inside her arms.</p>
  <p>Go on, say it, tell her everything.</p>
 <p>“Sarah, I know who you were before.”</p>
<h1 id="uMqy7tUwcQa27t2hvQg2iXA">25</h1>
<p>“No. you know nothing. But this is the same story that happens all the time and I’m aware of how it ends. I liked you so much from the first time I saw you and knew exactly what would happen ever since. It could have been perfect, the best of all the stories. Go to a concert, kiss each other, see each other for four, five days more and say goodbye. It could have booed great. I would have taken you to another bar tomorrow. I would have let you touch my ass and would have lead your hand to my breast. I would have told you all my desires and would have taken the liberty of daydreaming of you in futures that would never happen. You would have been the perfect boy for five days. For deep inside yourself, you know nothing, Andrés. You don’t know the things I knew about myself since the day I was born. At fifteen, my parents thought I was a shy, homosexual boy that sooner or later would come out of the closet, but when I finally did I came out through another door and broke their hearts. My mother cried saying it was all her fault, that she always wanted her first pregnancy to bear a daughter, that everything was as a result of her wish. That’s when I took to therapy, and my parents attended therapy, later the three of us went together and every night one of us took turns to cry, as if we had to share out guilts and duties, them for having me and me for being myself. Have you ever cried for something so harmless like just being yourself? I felt like changing my mind, I felt like wanting to keep being someone that existed for everybody else except me. But everything was about stop being afraid, about assuming the rage, about embracing the imperfection. I close all my online profiles, said goodbye to all my friends. I went to Saskatoon once the change reach the point of no return and overnight, staying at my cousin’s place, I started to live the life as someone else, and went to school with my real name, and started to make friends with my real name, then understood how decisive it is to have a name of one’s own, an assumed name, a precise name. But along with that name I learnt to be broken hearted. I learnt to leve details out. I learnt to seize the moment and enjoy it only as it lasts, for sooner or later a boy would take his hand down to my pubis. So the day it happened I knew I would have to disappoint one boy after another. You should have seen his face. And you should have seen mine next day, the deep bruises, the broken lips. You should have seen me. But you, for a change, you made me feel common, you made me feel normal. I liked that you got all jittery and your messy way of pretending, I liked that you knew nothing about music, I liked the way you looked with your big fat old-fashioned headphones and the fact that on them sounded the music I discovered during the year I was most broken. I liked thinking that all this time the person that would cherish me was in Mexico, waiting for a chance, waiting for a flight to come here without knowing we would met and would make me feel normal for a week. I didn’t plan to tell you anything. I didn’t plan to tell you a single detail. I didn’t plan anything else than take your arm, and drive you among the crowd to the front row, I didn’t plan to anything else than kiss you a couple of times and give you a blowjob on the last day. Because it would have been perfect that way. You’d be gone without knowing and it would have been perfect. But now that you know it I can tell you that you know nothing. Tell your father nothing happened, go and tell him you’re no fag, so I will tell my parents you never ever dared to even touch me. This is the same story as always, and I know well what follows."</p>
<h1 id="uZDpwcgqifXjDiFfQF8Gk5D">26</h1>
<p>Sarah’s father tells yours to go fuck himself over the phone. The yelling is heard even from Sarah’s bedroom, where you and her look at each other from the opposite edges of the couch, not knowing what to say.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry to tell you this, Juan, but go to hell! You can’t say that things about my daughter neither treat your son like that! Don’t threaten to come here, ‘cause I’ll call the fucking police and they will take no one but you. You know, he’ll stay here until you stop acting like an asshole. You know, I’ll take him with you tomorrow. You know, I’m aware there’s a storm coming, fuck it, you’re not the only one watching the news. OK, then he’ll stay until the day after tomorrow and that’s it! Juan, stop threatening me, you know I’m a black belt… Oh, you even dare to ask? In karate and in busting your ass, if it comes handy! Yeah, I will, I’ll drive him to your place once the winter storm is over!”</p>
<p>Ann comes into the bedroom offering you a pajama and announces that you’ll sleep in the studio.</p>
<p>“I hope it’s not a nuisance”, she says as nothing has happened. It seems she’s the only one able to see this whole situation quite naturally: it’s just that the boy her daughter dates is staying the night for an extraordinary cause. For a moment you even believe she’s smiling inside her with a barely noticeable flexure on the corner of her lips, which fades away once Albert comes inside the room and apologizes for everyone in the only manner it is possible for a six foot tall, two hundred and sixty pounds, eyeglasses and curly hair:</p>
<p>“This cannot be possible! I thought your father was a level-headed man, but look at the nonsenses his making out of this. Really, Undress, I apologize for all of this mess”, he says as he waves and flaps his arms anxiously, from elbows to fingertips, like a T Rex toy. Has it been any other situation you’d be rolling on the floor laughing just to behold such a way of displaying anger.</p>
<p>Before going to sleep, you take a look at the books that wrap the four walls around you. At the front edge of a shelf devoted to American poetry, you find the picture of a baby wearing an awful yellow romper suit that vanished well into the nineties.</p>
<p>“I was less than a year old in that picture”, says Sarah behind you.<br/>
  “I supposed it was you.”<br/>
  “I just came to ask if there’s anything else you need.”<br/>
  “I left my walkman at my father’s but besides it there’s nothing else I need.”<br/>
  “I also came to say I’m really sorry.”<br/>
  “If this ends with your father beating the shit out mine, I guess these apologies would be out of place.”</p>
<h1 id="uOhlqvd9fgwE3WBFZoAkeO7">27</h1>
<p>All TV news talk about the worst ever April winter storm in Toronto. The airport is closed and could stay like that for a couple of days. Your flight might be delayed but almost anything matters to you by now. Sarah has came to wake you up on her way back from the bathroom. Still sleepy, you follow the pure scent of pancakes and fried bacon to the kitchen. Everything seems to show that Albert Thompson is a tremendous cook, able to turn a monotonous dish into an unusual delicacy. You sit beside Matt and Claire, who doesn’t hesitate to drop the routinely uncomfortable questions right before you declare breakfast time has started:</p>
<p>“Are you mi sister’s boyfriend?”<br/>
  “Claire, for God’s sake! Apologize”, says Anne.<br/>
  “Really, it’s OK”, you claim, but Claire is still looking at you with inquiring eyes.<br/>
  “Would you like it?”, you ask her.<br/>
  “You don’t seem a bad guy”, she replies with a stately gesture before drinking a sip from her glass of milk.</p>
<p>Super naive but charming, that’s the way you’d define the Thompsons. They cause you a kind of tenderness linked to envy. When was the last time you had a breakfast like this? When had you been part of a family like this? You barely talk to your sister, briefly see your mother during mornings, no need to talk about your father. Albert discusses football with you and Sarah rubs her leg with yours underneath the table. All of you have breakfast as if there was no future, for at this house everybody eat as if there was no future. May be the out of proportion intake of carbohydrates has something to do with weather: after all, behind the window it’s actually snowing as if the world’s end has already happened.</p>
<p>The next couple of days will be quite similar to the breakfast: you’ll play cards (you’ll lose the shirt off your back), Risk (you’ll win almost accidentally) Monopoly (Matt will beat the shit out of everyone else) and you’ll use any excuse to undertake exemplary gateways to the basement where Sarah will be waiting for you. To be honest, at this point no one cares about whatever you do with Sarah, but the adrenaline factor will turn each escapade into a little game where you can go away from Claire’s carping gaze, your father’s phantom, who won’t call on the phone —not even once—; Sarah and you will spend two days out of time: You’ll watch movies, always eat as if there was no future, play on the turntable almost all of Sarah’s record collection, and you’ll even find yourself studying Sarah’s childhood pictures, not without a baffling shame, not without your father’s words flying over your head like vultures, but Sarah will place her face against your shoulder letting you know that all pictures tell lies.</p>
<h1 id="ulrrQ2XxagC4YqVXAl3ISPH">28</h1>
<p>What is the relation between hymen and hymn?<br/>
  Your hands never went below her waist.<br/>
  Otherwise you’d have never cum.<br/> 
  She might have hymn,<br/>
  a surgical one, between her legs.<br/>
  But lying on your back<br/>
  you know that <i>we</i><br/>
  is actually<br/>
  a genderless pronoun.</p>
<h1 id="ukFafCokr2HbVa7PlR9Wxk2">29</h1>
<p>The warm glare of the clear blue sky woke you up as a slap on your face. You woke with Sarah beside you but didn’t say goodbye to her. She had demanded you to do so as both of you shared the earpods of her iPod. Before falling asleep you heard only two songs: “Lover’s Spit” and “Everlong”.</p>
<p>Albert was already waiting for you at the kitchen, ready to take you home. You refused to have breakfast and claimed you already said goodbye to Sarah.</p>
  <p>“Are you sure?”, he said while he took the last sip from his coffee.<br/>
  “Sure”.</p>
<p>Once in the car you barely had the time to hear a Joy Division song.</p>
  <p>“Even I can have a cool taste”, bragged Albert as soon as he recognized your amazement."<br/>
  “Don’t worry. I didn’t know about them before coming here.”</p>
  <p>“Then the journey has been worthwhile, Undress.”</p>
<p>Your father was outside when you arrived. You stepped out of the car to pass in front of him without greeting him. He stays in the porch, smoking the first cigarette of the day, as he had a word with Albert. From your bedroom’s window you could see your father raising his voice and Sarah’s father frantically shaking his arms. Albert said goodbye with a deadeye punch over your father’s jaw.</p>
<p>Now you think about a lot of stuff as you pack your baggage and spot the airplane ticket that your father left on the shelf, noticing that your flight takes off in a scant three hours: You think you must phone your sister as soon as you land in Mexico and pay her a visit, you think of your mother and how will you get along telling her everything that happened to you, you think of the conversation you might have with your father within few minutes and think of Sarah, of her breast and buttocks, of the books you didn’t gave her back and of all the music you discovered with her. You don’t want to depart. Not like this.</p>
<p>You hear your father as he goes up the stairs.</p>
<p>“Can we talk?”, he says as he goes inside your bedroom, still rubbing his jaw.</p>
<p>But there’s not a lot to talk about. You accept his —delightfully fake— apologies and hear his speech and tame regret for ruining your travel. How can it really be ruined if you don’t really want to leave? This is the kind of conversation that both of you may have in two years when you come back, or when you graduate, or when you get married. They might always be apologies from one to each other, there might always be an aftertaste of all of this and everything else before, and for the first time you look at your father to find a man that is quite a bit old and a quite a bit good, quite a bit moron and quite a bit smart, a man that rubs his jaw while he apologizes: This is the first time you look at your father and see nothing else but that:  A man like any other man. You might have your own children someday, and surely you will do as good as you can, and surely you will spectacularly fuck everything up, and upon a day —you’ve already foreseen— your own son will look at you to discover that you were always a man like any other man. </p>
<p>Say goodbye to Claudia and your future brother. Say goodbye in your head to every nook and cranny in this house that was never yours until now, and say goodbye to a clear blue sky as the snow melts on the sidewalks and gardens.</p>
<p>You get on the car among a silence as deep as that from the day your father picked you up at the airport, but soon, just a few blocks forward, you ask him to stop.</p>
<p>“Why?”<br/>
“Just stop, dad!”</p>
<p>Your father hit the brakes suddenly and asks:</p>
<p>“Is there anything you’re missing?”</p>
<p>So you get off the car, holding your backpack in your arms and run as much as you can, you stumble a couple of times on the frozen floor, little by little your body recovers an energy akin to that you used to feel at every soccer game as you ran to the goal area, the kind of heat you used to feel as you shot to score, exactly the same blood stroke to the one you felt attending your first concert ever, exactly the same as when you heard your favorite song for the first time. You’ll never find the iPod you lost before coming here, that iPod which contained only songs by the Foo Fighters, and Gorillaz and Linkin Park, that iPod which you’ll never need anymore. Could it feel real like this forever and ever? Could all of it feel as good as this once again? You only want to say goodbye, give Sarah the old tapes and the walkman and say goodbye, say goodbye the way you should and tell her to listen to those cassette tapes, to listen only to those old tapes.</p>

<p>Today, Andrés, you have crossed the Behring Strait amidst the last Ice Age, today you sail the only surviving ship of the first mission to circumnavigate the Globe, you kept silence before the entrance of a palace at Nepal, you woke up during the siege of a walled city and made a dog fall asleep with the strum of your lyre,  today you had the glimpse of an empire as you step on a little islet in the middle of a lake and unintentionally established a new era at the Gulf of Mexico beaches, you decoded the radium performance and also step on a streetcar at Vienna where you only meditate on the nature of time, today you went down into an enchanted cavern in Albacete only to come back asleep, and board on a ferry with your rock band to travel from Liverpool to Hamburg, at 27 years old your eyes were the first to see the round shape of the Earth and you got off a beat-up Chevrolet at the crosswalk of Insurgentes and Reforma avenue after driving the long road all the way from New York. Today, Andrés, you’re rising through the Northern Hemisphere skies heading home while someone on the ground listens —on your sister’s walkman— to all those anthems you discovered on the road, all those anthems composed in her honor.</p>
